**Weighted KNN Classifier**
This is a weighted K Nearest Classifier from scratch. In the file "KNearestNeighbor_weighted.py" a classifier is created which accepts a value "weighted" to be True or False. If weighted is assigned to be True weighted KNN classification is applied else a normal KNN approach is followed. In the file "KNN_test_weighted.py" a the KNN classifier is tested according to the user input. When the user gives a value 1 the normal KNN classification is carried out and when given a value 2 the weighted KNN classification is followed.

**Technologies used:**
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Counter
